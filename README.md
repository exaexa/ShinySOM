# ShinySOM

Installation:

```r
devtools.install_github('exaexa/EmbedSOM')
devtools.install_github('exaexa/DiffSOM')
devtools.install_github('exaexa/ShinySOM')
```

Before running, you need to create some space for data:

```sh
mkdir data      # scratch space for the user
mkdir datasets  # dataset storage
```

Running is then easy:

```r
library(ShinySOM)
ShinySOM()
```

Rigorous documentation does not exist yet. Spam me with mail/issues with any questions.

Some functions are simply not implemented yet; if you want something available quickly, please open a feature request.
